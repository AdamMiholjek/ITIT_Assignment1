    About Me
  </h1>
  
    <h2>
      Introduction:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Adam Miholjek, I am a 21 year old male currently studying Information Technology at RMIT university. 
      My student number is s3864779 and student email is s3864779@student.rmit.edu.au.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Nationality & Ethnicity:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Australia and have lived there my entire life. My cultural background is half-Croatian and half-Greek, but almost nobody ever guesses that correctly!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Education & Employment:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have currently only finished High-school as I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to study afterwartds. In the meantime, I have spent 3 years working at a computer store in almost every role available, including:<br>
      <br>
       - Small servicing/technician jobs<br>
       - Customer service<br>
       - Warranty returns<br>
       - Warehouse<br>
       - Sales<br>
       - Website & product management<br>
       - Installing computer systems<br>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Other Details & Hobbies:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am currently only fluent in English, however I wish to eventually speak a large variety of languages. I have small amounts of knowledge in Greek, Italian, Croatian, Japanese and German, while currently actively pursuing learning of German and Croatian.<br>
      My favourite pets to own are birds, especially parrots. I absolutely love how much personality they develop and how lovely they can be. I currently don't own one but I am dying to get a blue Indian Ringneck parrot in the near future.<br>
      I also played baseball for 10 years with my local team, the Five Dock Falcon Baseball Club from when I was 8 all the way to 18. In my last few years and the years following, I also began working for them as a baseball scorer.
