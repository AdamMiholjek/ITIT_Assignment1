      Lead Software Developer</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    My ideal job is as a Lead Software Developer, so I have found a job advertisement for one on seek.com from Portable Pty Ltd. 
	This position requires the software developer to manage and execute large development projects, deliver high quality technical 
	work, and to mentor & manage other team members in projects. This specific position is particularly appealing to me because of 
	the company Portable themselves. Portable is a company which works to create a positive impact for people in areas of mental 
	health, education, access to justice and death & ageing. I would love to design technologies which help people, especially in 
	collaboration with organisations like Headspace.
	<br>
	Some of the skills required for this job include:
	Leading by example
	 - The ability to lead others not by explanation, but by example.
	Complex problem solving
	 - The ability to create solutions across multiple aspects, not just technical
	Analysis
	 - -The ability to analyse positives and negatives on a project/team to create effective feedback
	Team mentoring
	 - -The ability to provide team members with mentoring, to push them to be their best.
	Team skills
	 - -The ability to work as a team/work with others
	In-depth programming skills
	 - -A wide range of programming knowledge & languages
	Project management
	 - -The ability to create, manage, and execute projects
	 <br>
	A required qualification for this position would most likely include a degree in software development at the very least, 
	otherwise maybe a degree in business/project management. As for experience, the job advertisement doesnâ€™t list anything, however, 
	I would imagine that one would need adequate experience in the programming field for the intense technical requirements, and also 
	would require management experience.
	Currently, my skills, qualification and experience are far behind, leaving me with a fair amount of work to do in order to gain 
	this position. I do not have any qualifications besides completing my HSC. For experience, I have worked in a computer store for 3 
	years in a customer service role which has improved upon my negotiation & compromisational skills. My programming skills are lacking, 
	with very basic knowledge of C#, C++, Java, HTML, Python 3 & Javascript.
	In order to achieve a job as a lead software developer, I imagine that my road to obtaining the required skills, qualifications and 
	experience begins with university. I am currently studying subjects in the Bachelors of Information Technology degree in order to 
	improve on my IT & project management skills and hopefully create a pathway for myself towards a Bachelors of Software Development. 
	Along the way, I should also strive to either independently create projects, or obtain a job in the field to improve on my programming 
	skills & portfolio of experience. I have close friends who are also studying similar fields who may be able to assist with the prior. 
	I will need to work in teams to improve upon my currently lacking team leadership skills. After the degrees, and work experience in 
	similar fields, I hope to become eligible for this lead software developer position.
