    Personal Interest in IT
  </h2>
  <h3>
    What is my interest in IT?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am extremely interested in the both the hardware and software aspects of IT, from how computers and software run, 
    to how I can use IT to make aspects of my life more efficient. I love creating programs & games and I also like to 
    build computers systems.
  </p>
  <h3>
    How did I get into IT?
  </h3>
  <p>
    My interest in IT started at a very young age, most likely around the time I first started playing video games. 
    My dad is probably the sole reason that I love IT as much as I do as he was the one to introduce me to, teach me about, 
    and cultivate my love of technology. My dad, while not working in the field of IT, still kept up to date on all the latest 
    technology regardless of the face he was born in the early 60s. He loved how useful, fun and nifty technology could be. 
    When I played video games on console at families' or friends' houses, my dad noticed how interested I was and bought us our 
    first console, the PS2. I remember playing Ratchet & Clank all the time, exploring every nook and cranny the game had to 
    offer. My dad also provided me with an account on the family PC from a young age, eventually giving me my own hand-me-down 
    windows XP machine to experiment with. My dad taught me plenty about computers, the lingo, what a PC is made up of, how it 
    works, and how to use software to create the things that I was interested in.

  <h3>
    My IT experience
  </h3>
  <p>
    My personal experience in IT has grown throughout the different stages of my life.<br><br>
    <b>Early Childhood:</b> 
    During my early life, most of my IT experience came from all the things that my dad taught me about & my time using PCs and 
    game consoles.<br><br>
    <b>Primary School:</b> 
    In primary school, we had regular 'computer lessons' where the whole class would go the the computer room to learn basics 
    about operating computers & doing work with them. I used this time to mess around with the school website and play around 
    with the many features on a computer.<br><br>
    <b>High School:</b> 
    In high school, they gave us all our own personal school laptops to use which we could take home with us inbetween school. 
    The amount of software on them was insane and I spent as much time as possible playing around with and learning various 
    different softwares. I also took the Information & Software Technology course during years 9 & 10, and the Information 
    Processing Technology course in years 11 & 12.<br><br>
    <b>Post-school:</b> 
    Since after high-school, I have been working in a computer store where I get to learn about all the latest hardware 
    releases, build computers systems, work on the company's website(sometimes) and even do some small servicing jobs on systems.

  <h2>
    Interest in RMIT as a learning institute for IT
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Why did I choose RMIT, and what do I expect to learn?
  </h3>
  <p> I chose RMIT University through Open Universities Australia. I decided to go with RMIT as it appeared to be a lot more 
    suited towards IT degrees than some of the other universities that were out there. Not only that, but their OUA 
    course/degree page was a lot more descriptive of the kind of work we would be doing, and what we could do after the degree. 
    One other big reason I chose RMIT was that it appeared to be a lot more focused on the programming side of things, and I 
    wish to pursue a career which is more heavily reliant on programming.
<br>I expect to gain a great set of foundational skills for further learning from RMIT, especially in the way of programming 
    skills but also hopefully in the less technical side of things too, such as the ethics of IT, skills for working with 
    businesses & other IT individuals, and hopefully some communication skills.
