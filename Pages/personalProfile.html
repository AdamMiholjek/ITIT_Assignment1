  </h3>
  <p>
    Upon completion of a free online Myers-Briggs test, 16 personalities, I received the result of being a 'Mediator' or type
	'INFP-T'. Mediators are classified by their idealism, open-mindedness, empathy, creativity, passion, morals, and desire
	to help others. Mediators are also defined by their position on the personality scales (INFP-T), they tend to be
	introverted, intuitive, feeling, prospective and turbulent. I believe these results mean that I do have the ability to
	mentor others and push them in a position direction to better themselves. While I may not enjoy bossing around others, I
	can cooperatively work with them on equal footing while still delegating tasks and mentoring them, which I feel works for
	my ideal job. I can always act as... well, a mediator for conflicts with other team members as well.

  <p>
    The results of my learning style tests have shown that I am multimodal learner, with my learning styles from highest to 
	lowest being kinaesthetic, visual, auditory, and finally reading/writing, with all but reading/writing being very close in 
	results. I knew beforehand that I liked to learn best by doing, however, I didn’t know just how well I would learn by visual 
	and auditory styles, although I did know that they were my stronger suits. I for sure did not know beforehand how horribly I 
	tanked in reading/writing learning style until I began to do the test and was self-analysing. In a team, my learning styles 
	will probably be shown the most by the way that I present my information to other team members, and how I receive the 
	information they share with me. To improve my team dynamic, I should first try to form a team with as few reading/writing 
	learners as possible, as I don’t cater very well to that learning style. When it comes to the other learning types, I should 
	ask my team members which they are more comfortable with in order to communicate to a greater extent with them.

  <p>
    The last test that I took was a career test, which tested my personal interests and provided me with results in a variety of 
	categories. These interest groups included, from highest to lowest scoring, investigative, artistic, social, realistic, 
	conventional and enterprising. These results have shown that while I love to observe, analyse and solve problems, I might not 
	be able to do so very well through businesses and bureaucracy. This means that while working with a team, I will be more helpful 
	through analysing and solving problems, however, might have some issues with working with larger group sizes at times as things 
	will get impersonal. When forming a team, these results mean that I should probably attempt to at least group with another 
	individual who excels in what I am lacking, for example, an individual with more detail-oriented skills, or who prefer 
	persuasion and performance.
