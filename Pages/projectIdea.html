  <h1>
    My Project Idea
  </h1>
  
  <h2>
    Providing a Medium for the Education & Diagnosis of Mental Illnesses
  </h2>
  <p>
    The course of events over the past year have been catastrophic to many mentally, physically and financially. I would like to focus on the mental health issues that many have faced due to a variety of reasons. 
	I would like to create an application/website database of mental health issues which provides users with a variety of information on these issues including, what they are, how to identify them, and tips on how 
	to approach solving these issues for oneself, or for others.<br><br>
	
	According to the Australian Government Department of Health, “Almost half of all Australians aged 16 to 85 years — 7.3 million people — will experience mental illness at some point in their life.” with some of 
	the most common conditions being anxiety, affective disorders (e.g. depression), and substance abuse. Australia also spent $9 billion in 2015-2016 on mental health services, and it is estimated that the cost of 
	severe mental illness on the economy is around $56.7 billion a year. For these mental health issues that plague such a large number of people, I would primarily like to use this application to provide individuals 
	with an identification tool, which can push them to taking the first steps to improving their mental health. With the obscenely large quantity of individuals suffering from mental illness in Australia alone, this 
	application could serve, assist and be used by a numerous user-base.<br><br>
	
	First and foremost, it should be stressed that the application should never be used as a replacement for a health professional. Instead, the intended use is to educate individuals about the many forms mental illness 
	takes, what someone suffering this illness is going through, how to identify these illnesses, and where to seek help.The application would have a few sections that serve different purposes. <br>
	Firstly, there would be a database of mental illnesses, in which a user can browse and explore. Upon selecting an illness, information will be provided on the symptoms of the illness, how to identify those symptoms, 
	what someone with the illness may experience and their viewpoint, and a section for what to do if you think that you, or someone else might have said illness. There would also be links and phone numbers to different 
	websites, services and specialist recommendations that are specifically chosen for the specified illnesses. On each of the illnesses’ pages on the database, there would also be a screening/diagnostic tool/quiz made 
	for each illness for individuals who think they may have the selected illness to then perform. This would provide a result much like online screening tests for the illness which can hopefully provide indicators for 
	if the user possibly may be suffering from that illness, and a recommendation to get diagnosed by a professional if the screening is likely.<br>
	The second section would be almost like a questionnaire/diagnostic tool for identifying possible illnesses. While it may not be extremely accurate, it should be used as a screening for specific illnesses. This section 
	would almost act like a branched FAQ, where at first, there would be a prompt such as: “In the last X period of time, I have frequently felt” with answers for the user to choose between such as;
	<br> - like I’ve had no motivation to do anything<br>
	 - like I have to energy at all<br>
	 - like I’m not worthy of some things<br>
	 - like I can’t focus on anything<br>
	 - multiple mood swings<br>
	 - not in control of myself<br><br>
	Then, after selecting an option, further prompts and answers would appear, eventually narrowing down the possible mental issue/s that someone may be facing.<br>
	The third sections would be a database of facilities, phone numbers and websites that are specifically geared towards mental illnesses, e.g. Headspace, AusGov Department of Health, ReachOut, etc. This section would be 
	sorted by location, so, if you live in Sydney metro, you would be able to view relevant locations and contact details that are closer to you, whereas someone from rural QLD may get different results. The purpose of this 
	section is to provide individuals with contact details for places that deal with mental health that are more specialised towards their specific region. This section would also apply if the application would expand to 
	overseas, e.g. people in New Zealand would call a NZ hotline, not an Australian one.<br>
	
	<br>Ideally, for this project, I would prefer for there to be both website & mobile application versions, however, since the purpose for this project is to provide individuals with a convenient collection of information on 
	mental illnesses, the mobile application is my first priority. For the mobile application, there is really no hardware equipment needed for the development of the app except for the mobiles themselves to test with. For 
	software, there would be a need for an application to develop with, such as MIT app inventor, Appery.io, or Good Barber. The app could most likely be developed without these tools, however, with my current skills it is 
	unfeasible to create the app from scratch within a reasonable timeframe.<br>
	
	<br>Relevant skills that will be needed include moderate programming, user-design, writing, and empathetic skills. Programming is required for building the application, user design is required for the visual and logistical 
	design of the app, and empathy & writing skills will be needed to write in-depth and relatable information for a variety of mental illnesses. Writing & user design are probably the most important skills due to the 
	sensitivity of the content, and the desired convenience of the app. Most of the programming and UX skills should not be too difficult to obtain as most of the app development software out there handles a lot of it and 
	provides good templates. For the writing, there will need to be a lot of in-depth research and interviews obtained in order to provide the depth of information desired, which may be slightly less feasible depending on 
	how many mental illnesses that this application will cover. This can be mitigated by initially developing the application with only the most common mental illnesses in mind, and expanding later.<br>
	
	<br>Ideally, if this project is successful then a lot more people will become much more educated in the topic and field of mental health, and individuals with mental health issues can identify their issues and seek 
	professional help, hopefully being more comfortable with their problems too. With more knowledge of mental illnesses, how they work, what they look like, and what people go through, hopefully more individuals can also 
	notice the problems that those they are close to are going through. Being able to identify mental illness in others is impossible unless one knows what to look for. Mental illness will never go away, but if this 
	application gives individuals the ability to take the very first step in identifying the problem and providing them with information on where to go, then  more people can adequately deal with the problems they are facing.
